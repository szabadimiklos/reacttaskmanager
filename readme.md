# Learn React
## How to use

    git clone https://github.com/szabadimiklos/reacttaskmanager.git

After cloning, install the dependencies. In the root folder of the project:

    npm install

Now you are set to go, just start the server:

    npm start

And finally, in a different terminal, start the fake backend too:

    npm run fakejsonserver

After this, open (or refresh) http://localhost:3000/ . You should see the app running without any problems.
