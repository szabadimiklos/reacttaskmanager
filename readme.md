## How to use

Clone this repo

    git clone https://github.com/szabadimiklos/reacttaskmanager.git

After cloning, install the dependencies with npm. In the **root folder** of the project, run this command (give it some time, it can take a few minutes):

    npm install

Now just start the fake backend too:

    npm run fakejsonserver

And finally, in a **different terminal**, but still in the **root folder**, start the server:

    npm start

After this, open (or refresh, if already opened) this page: http://localhost:3000/  
You should see the app running without any problems.
